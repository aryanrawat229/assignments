    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol> 
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or
        in othe media.
      </li><br>
    <li>
        <strike>CSS is not necessary</strike>
        <mark>CSS saves a lot of work</mark>
        It can contol the layout of
        multiple web pages all at once
    </li><br>
    <li class="External">External stylesheet are stored in CSS file</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul><div class="ol-list">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li><br>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li><br>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li><br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
         however, <mark style="color: brown; font-weight: bold;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this 
         is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li><br>
        </div>
    </ul>

    <p class="para1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
         elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special
         in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </p>

    <p class="para2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. 
        Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.
    </p>

    <p class="para3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. 
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied
